## Task 2: Introduction
1. What networking constructs are used to direct traffic to the right application on a server?
```
ports
```
2. How many of these are available on any network-enabled computer?
```
65535
```
3.How many of these are considered "well-known"? (These are the "standard" numbers mentioned in the task).
```
1024
```
## Task 3: NMAP Switches
1. What is the first switch listed in the help menu for a 'Syn Scan' (more on this later!)?
```
-sS
```
2. Which switch would you use for a "UDP scan"?
```
-sU
```
3. If you wanted to detect which operating system the target is running on, which switch would you use?
```
-O
```
4. Nmap provides a switch to detect the version of the services running on the target. What is this switch?
```
-sV
```
5. The default output provided by nmap often does not provide enough information for a pentester. How would you increase the verbosity?
```
-v
```
6. Verbosity level one is good, but verbosity level two is better! How would you set the verbosity level to two?
(Note: it's highly advisable to always use at least this option)
```
-vv
```
7. We should always save the output of our scans -- this means that we only need to run the scan once (reducing network traffic and thus chance of detection), and gives us a reference to use when writing reports for clients.
What switch would you use to save the nmap results in three major formats?

8. What switch would you use to save the nmap results in a "normal" format?
```
-oN
```
9. A very useful output format: how would you save results in a "grepable" format?
```
-oG
```
10. Sometimes the results we're getting just aren't enough. If we don't care about how loud we are, we can enable "aggressive" mode. This is a shorthand switch that activates service detection, operating system detection, a traceroute and common script scanning.
How would you activate this setting?
```
-A
```
